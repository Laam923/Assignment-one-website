             <p>With the continuous development of the Internet to meet the growth of smart cities and the 4th
   industrial revolution, technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things), cloud computing, artificial
   intelligence, blockchain, big data, and embodied internet are increasingly being integrated into the
   fabric of our lives and works. These technologies pose tremendous challenges to industries and
   organisations in developing data driven products and services. How to adopt new technologies for
   digital transformation of the business to keep up with the market to meet needs and demands is
   becoming a top priority for management.
  
      <br> </br>
       Data driven product is built on product co-ownership, in which the business and users share
   product usage information throughoutthe product life cycle to create values for both sides. The data
   product will continuously generate data about its users and usages. These data products start with
   a set of assumptions about their users. Through user interactions, the assumptions will be verified
   and validated, resulting in improvement in product features to serve better user experience.
     <br> </br>
   As smart, connected, and data driven products and services become more prevalent in this coming
   decade, knowing the sources of data and acquiring them programmatically for further cleaning,
   filtering, aggregation, modelling, evaluation, visualisation, and on-demand interaction are crucial
   for achieving high productivity, business excellence, and custom satisfaction. This course aims to
   help students understand the context of this development and equip them with the required
   research, design, coding and testing skills for pursuing a career in the field.</p>
